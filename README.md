# Terraform Examples

This repository is a gathering of Terraform code and configs, to illustrate what can be done in Microsoft Azure with Terraform. The reason why I'm creating this is to help promote use of Terraform with Azure, as well as having a place to store my demonstrations from talks and presentations. A curated selection of Terraform code, if you will.
